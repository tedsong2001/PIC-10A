# PIC-10A
Projects that I worked on for PIC 10A (Introduction to C++ Programming)

### HW 1: Digits
- Converts miles to kilometers, kilometers to miles, standard time to military time, and military time to standard time.

### HW 1: Conversions
- Asks users to input two integers and performs operations on those integers.

### HW 2: MonthName
- Provides the first two characters of a given string and a month name.

### HW 2: RightTriangle
- Asks users to input 3 values and checks if those values can make up a right triangle.

### HW 3: Primes
- Asks users to input an n-value and outputs the n-th Fibonacci and prime number.

### HW 3: RemoveCommas
- Input a number as a string (e.g., 500,000) and removes the commas.

### HW 4: Maximizer
- Asks user to input a range and the coefficients of a cubic polynomial, and finds the largest possible value over the range.

### HW 5: RandomWalker
- Random walker game where user sets lower and upper limits, a starting point, and number of trials and calculates possibility of winning (if position reaches upper limit).

### HW 5: HW5
- Does four operations: sorting a list of numbers, finding the area of a rectangle given a width and length, comparing the length of two words, and reversing the order of a list of numbers.

### HW 6: Cars
- Car class that records the cars' current gas level after a drive and/or adding gas.

### HW 6: Country
- Country class that records the name, population, population density, and area of multiple countries.

### HW 7: PigLatin
- "Translates" a string of text into Pig Latin

### HW 7: Same
- Finds if two arrays have the same distinct elements.
